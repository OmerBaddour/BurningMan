# BurningMan

Contains a program which calculates the shortest path between two given locations in Burning Man. My proof of the optimality of the algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/OmerBaddour/BurningMan/blob/master/Burning_Man_Shortest_Path_Algorithm.pdf).

## Usage

```
$ javac BurningMan.java
$ java BurningMan
```

You'll be prompted to input your current and desired locations during runtime. Optimal path traversal instructions will be output.
